Here is the flow:

Look for txt files that have not been processed.

With each txt file:
	Find the corresponding spreadsheet to determine the reference number.
	Add the reference number to the txt file
	Add the reference number to the spreadsheet
	Convert the text file to a pdf
	Remove the original txt file

I think that's it. I'm worried about concurrency with the users. I hate working with files.
