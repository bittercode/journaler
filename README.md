journaler
=========

This is a project that I'm using to help the finance team in our office.

What I'm doing follows a business process that is rather specific but someone may be able to use the code to do something that fits a process of their own.

We have emails that record authorization of account transfers. Those emails will be saved as text files and then this code will pick them up. Users need to save the files in the proper location as the program will use where they sit to know how to name than and which spreadsheet to update.

The journal spreadsheets will get a link to the file on the network so that an auditor can click on the link in the spreadsheet and pull up the file.
